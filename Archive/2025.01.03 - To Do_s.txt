Design

DONE
- code -
- have UI adjust winsorizer thresholds based on volatility. more volatile = 0.05, 0.95, less volatile = 0.15, 0.85.
* Candlesticks. 
    - Put forecast (for close) over the candlesticks. 
    Does it make sense? Do the candlesticks significantly overlap the forecast boundaries?
    Do I need to build more to include high, low, open into the forecast?
# ask chat to add descriptions to each function.

- app -
* Make sure that visual includes OG closing data, not model. I want it to reflect the actual data.

* note that training size is automatically adjusted based on the volatility of the stock. 
    it will slow down processing times. you exchange accuracy for a longer wait time. 
    the purpose is to improve the model.

# use 'Next Steps' at the bottom of app for basis of description

# make sure the entire app is formatted the same clean way

* have accuracy score view show progress of metrics improvement. 
    so on each iteration, reveal new changes. 
    'Standard Model', 'Model with Winsorizer', 'Final Model with Hyperparameter Tuning'
    * 'Current Metrics' for non-final models, 'Final Metrics' for teh final model

* mention that grid search is cross validated across the dataset

* cache model data?

function definitions

AFTER CODE & APP ARE DONE
* have program run thru AWS lambda free-tier. that way you can gain & showcase a little data engineering knowledge.
