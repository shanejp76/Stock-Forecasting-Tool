# Stock Forecasting Tool - Modernization Roadmap

<!-- FORMATTING NOTE: This roadmap has two sections only:
1. PHASES: Active work items with consistent Phase X format, objectives, and implementation steps
2. COMPLETED: Finished work grouped by category with checkmarks and brief descriptions
Keep all active work in Phases, all finished work in Completed. No mixing of statuses. -->

## Phases

### Phase 2: Advanced Feature Engineering
**Priority**: Medium  
**Objective**: Integrate research from archive notebooks and enhance technical analysis capabilities

**Implementation Steps**:
- Extract winsorization techniques from `2024.12.30 - Winsorizing + Optimization` notebooks
- Add dynamic technical indicators (Stochastic, Williams %R, CCI, ATR)
- Implement rolling correlation windows and sector analysis
- Create configurable feature engineering pipeline with outlier detection

### Phase 3: Application Performance Optimization  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Objective**: Enhance user experience and application scalability

**Implementation Steps**:
- Implement BigQuery connection pooling with intelligent caching
- Add lazy loading and background model training with progress indicators
- Create real-time updates and interactive parameter tuning interface
- Build model comparison dashboard and historical backtesting

### Phase 4: Production Monitoring & Automation
**Priority**: High  
**Objective**: Ensure production reliability and operational excellence

**Implementation Steps**:
- Implement comprehensive BigQuery error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Add data pipeline monitoring with freshness alerts and quality validation
- Create operational dashboards for system health and performance metrics
- Enhance user experience with background processing and progress indicators

### Phase 5: Advanced Analytics Platform
**Priority**: Low  
**Objective**: Transform into comprehensive financial analytics platform

**Implementation Steps**:
- Implement dbt transformation layer for SQL-based feature engineering
- Add real-time data streaming and instant market updates
- Integrate alternative ML models and ensemble methods
- Create portfolio-level analysis and risk management tools
